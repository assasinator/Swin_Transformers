# Swin_Transformers
In the midst of emerging technology, there was particularly one specific machine learning model that caught the attention of researchers: ’Transformers’. They are attention based model which was able to beat the state-of-the-art model for computer vision tasks but it is still unexplored properly in Medical domains. Due to which in this projects we are mainly focusing on the use of transformer as a binary classification model for Chest X-ray images. Throughout this project we will be going more in-depth about the architecture of transformers and their implementation in computer vision task.However, this project does not focus on producing a new findings, rather, on testing the performance of transformers for chest X-ray images compared to different State-of-the-art Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs), Deep Neural Networks(DNN) models.
